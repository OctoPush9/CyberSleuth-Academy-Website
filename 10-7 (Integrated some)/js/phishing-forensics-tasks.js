        <p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack that tricks people into clicking fake links or opening harmful files.</p>

        <p>These emails look like they come from trusted sources, but they are sent by attackers who want to steal information or install malware.</p>

        <p>As a cybersecurity learner, you need to know how to spot the signs and examine emails carefully.</p>

        <p>In this lab, you will check the sender, inspect links and attachments, and look at the tone of the message.</p>

        <p>You will also learn how to report phishing and how email security tools help detect fake messages.</p>

        <p>An email header is like the envelope for your message. It shows who sent it, when it was sent, and which servers moved it along the way.</p>

        <p>The From line shows who claims to be the sender. This name can be faked by attackers. The Reply-To line shows where your reply will go. If that is different from the From line, it might be a trick.</p>

        <p>The Received lines list each server that handled the email, along with the time. These help you see if the message used normal paths or suspicious routes. For example, if a message says it is from your company but the first server is in another country, that can be a red flag.</p>

        <p>In Gmail, click the three dots and choose Show original to see the full header. In Outlook, open the email, click File, then Properties, and look in the Internet headers box.</p>

        <p>Always read the header starting from the bottom. Check each part for strange IP addresses, missing details, or signs that do not match the sender‚Äôs real domain. Look for DKIM or SPF results too. These help you check if the message is real or fake.</p>

        <p>Phishing emails often hide bad links that lead to fake websites. These links can look real in the email text but show a different address when you hover over them.</p>

        <p>Always move your mouse over a link to see where it really goes before you click. Look at the end of the link to find the true domain name.</p>

        <p>Scammers often use tricks to confuse you. They might add words or change spellings. For example, a link like <code>secure.microsoft-login.com.fake.site</code> looks like Microsoft but is really fake.site.</p>

        <p>Check if the link uses HTTPS. A real site should have <code>https://</code> and a secure lock icon. No lock or HTTP only can be risky.</p>

        <p>Be careful with short links or links that ask you to log in fast. If you feel unsure, copy the link and check it with an online scanner like VirusTotal.</p>

        <p>If an email tries to scare you into clicking quickly, slow down. Think twice before you trust any link.</p>

        <p>Phishing emails sometimes use attachments instead of links. These files can hide malware. Dangerous attachments include programs (.exe), compressed files (.zip), or documents (.docx, .pdf, .html).</p>

        <p>Watch out for tricks like double extensions. A file named <code>invoice.pdf.exe</code> is really a program, not a PDF. Attackers also hide real file types by adding fake endings or using settings that hide extensions in Windows.</p>

        <p>Be careful with HTML files too. Some emails attach .html files that open fake login pages or run scripts when you open them in your browser. This can connect to harmful websites without you knowing.</p>

        <p>Office files like Word or Excel can have hidden macros. Macros are small programs that run when you open the file. If you did not expect the file, never enable macros.</p>

        <p>Before opening any attachment, check if it looks strange or has two extensions. Scan it with antivirus or an online scanner like VirusTotal. If you are not sure, do not open it at all. When in doubt, ask your IT personnel for help.</p>

        <p>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC work together to protect email. They stop attackers from sending fake emails that look like they came from you.</p>

        <p><strong>SPF</strong> (Sender Policy Framework) is like a safe list. It tells which servers can send emails for a domain. When an email arrives, the receiver checks if it came from an allowed server. If not, it may be blocked or marked as fake.</p>

        <p><strong>DKIM</strong> (DomainKeys Identified Mail) adds a digital signature. This signature proves the email was not changed on its way to you. Think of it like a wax seal on a letter. If the seal is valid, the email is trusted.</p>

        <p><strong>DMARC</strong> connects SPF and DKIM. It tells email systems what to do if a message fails the checks, includes block it, mark it as spam, or report it. This helps stop spoofing and gives domain owners reports about any fake attempts.</p>

        <p>If you check an email header, you might see <code>spf=pass</code> or <code>dkim=pass</code>. This means the checks worked. If they fail, the email is likely fake.</p>

        <p>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC make phishing much harder by proving who really sent the email and keeping fake senders out.</p>

        <p>Phishing emails often sound urgent or scary. They push you to act fast before you think.</p>

        <p>Watch for words that threaten you, like ‚ÄúYour account will close‚Äù or ‚ÄúAct now or lose access.‚Äù These phrases create panic.</p>

        <p>Check how the email greets you. Real companies use your name. Fake ones might say ‚ÄúDear User‚Äù or ‚ÄúDear Customer.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Bad grammar or strange spelling are red flags too. Scammers often rush or use poor English to send out thousands of fake emails quickly.</p>

        <p>Be careful with big promises or warnings. If an email offers something too good to be true or threatens trouble, stop and think. Most real companies won‚Äôt ask for your password or payment by email.</p>

        <p>Always slow down and read carefully. The way an email sounds can tell you if it‚Äôs real or fake.</p>
