        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> In this lab, you'll join Zara and Alex as they investigate what happened. You'll learn how phishing works and how to catch the signs before it's too late.</p>

        <p>Phishing attacks often look like real emails from trusted companies. But they trick people into clicking fake links or opening dangerous files.</p>

        <p>You'll learn how to check email headers, look for shady links, and examine attachments. You'll also learn how to report phishing and understand how email tools protect users.</p>

        <p>Let's start by understanding the basics of phishing. Watch the short video below to see how these scams work.</p>

        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Zara is reviewing a suspicious email forwarded by Maya. At first glance, the message looks like a normal company update. The subject says ‚ÄúNew Update!‚Äù and appears to come from someone named Mike McDuck (<code>mmcduck@outlook.com</code>).</p>

        <p>But Alex teaches her to look deeper. They inspect the full email header and find something strange. The true sender isn't Mike at all. It came from <code>badguy_spammer@spammy.com</code> with an IP address traced to the United States: <code>184.83.22.146</code>.</p>

        <p>Later, the subject line mysteriously changes to ‚ÄúSuper Cheap Diet Pills!‚Äù and ‚ÄúSponsored Promotions >> Insurance Deals!‚Äù That's a clear red flag.</p>

        <p>Now Zara understands why it's important to check headers. Phishing emails often fake the ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù field. Only the full header shows who really sent it.</p>

        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Zara receives another report from Maya. This time, it's an email that looks like it came from Amazon. The message says ‚ÄúConfirm your identity to avoid account lockout.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Alex asks Zara to inspect the links. At first, the blue text says it goes to <code>https://amazon.com</code>. But when she hovers over it, she sees the truth: <code>redirect.kereskedj.com</code>. That's a totally different domain.</p>

        <p>Zara quickly realizes this is a phishing link. Real companies like Amazon don't ask for identity confirmation this way, and they definitely don't redirect through shady domains.</p>

        <p>Scammers often hide fake links behind text that looks familiar. That's why it's important to hover and check the actual destination before clicking anything.</p>

        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Maya receives an email with a file called <code>invoice-details.docx</code>. It says it's an urgent invoice she needs to open. Unsure what to do, she forwards it to Alex and Zara for help.</p>

        <p>Zara uploads the file to VirusTotal. The scan reveals the file is really <strong>malsample2.exe</strong> a dangerous malware flagged by many antivirus vendors. It includes trojans and backdoors that can steal data or give remote access to hackers.</p>

        <p>Alex explains that attackers often hide malware by naming it to look like a safe document. They also use double extensions like <code>.docx.exe</code> to confuse users. On some systems, only the first extension shows, making it seem harmless.</p>

        <p>He adds that even files like <code>.zip</code>, <code>.html</code>, or Office files can be risky. Some may contain macros or open fake login pages when clicked. It's always best to check the file type and sender before opening anything.</p>

        <p>The email greets her as ‚ÄúDear user‚Äù and says her account will be <em>inactive</em> if she doesn't click a link by end of day. The link points to <code>reviewuserinterface.com/verify</code>.</p>

        <p>Zara checks it and finds many red flags: generic sender name, vague instructions, fake urgency, and a suspicious link. There's even a grammar error: ‚Äúwill inactive all user accounts.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Alex says phishing emails often sound urgent, include threats, and avoid personal details. They rely on fear to make users click fast without thinking.</p>

        <p>Always slow down. Look at the sender, tone, spelling, and link before doing anything.</p>
