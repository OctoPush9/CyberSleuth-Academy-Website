  <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Amina just joined the security team at her company. During her training, she learns that not all cyber threats come from the outside. Some come from people already inside the organization. This include, employees, contractors, or partners.</p>

    <p>These insiders already have access to systems, so they don‚Äôt need to break in. That makes them harder to catch and sometimes more dangerous than outside hackers.</p>

    <p>Some insiders act on purpose, like stealing or leaking files. Others make careless mistakes or fall for phishing attacks.</p>

    <p>Amina wants to learn how to spot these insider threats and stop them before damage is done.</p>

        content: `
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Daniel has been feeling unhappy at work lately. One day, he copies client data to a USB drive without permission. Meanwhile, Amina notices that another co-worker, Sharon, often sends emails to the wrong people and once clicked a strange link. Later, the IT team finds out that someone's account was hijacked by a hacker.</p>

    <p>These are all insider threats, but each case is different:</p>

    <p><strong>Malicious insiders</strong> like Daniel act on purpose to cause harm. They might steal or leak data.</p>

    <p><strong>Negligent insiders</strong> like Sharon don‚Äôt mean to cause problems, but their careless mistakes still create risk.</p>

    <p><strong>Compromised insiders</strong> are people whose accounts are taken over by attackers. The hacker uses their access without being noticed.</p>

    <p>Knowing the types helps Amina understand what signs to watch for and how to respond.</p>

    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Amina is helping Mr Lim review staff access. She sees that Daniel still has access to client files, even though he moved to a different role. She also finds that another intern can open files that don‚Äôt match their job at all.</p>

    <p>Mr Lim explains that every employee should only have access to the data they actually need. This is called the <strong>principle of least privilege</strong> (PoLP). It‚Äôs also part of <strong>role-based access control</strong> (RBAC).</p>

    <p>He also shows her the company‚Äôs logging system. It tracks who opens, edits, or moves files. This helps them notice strange activity quickly.</p>

    <p>By fixing access issues and checking logs often, Amina can help stop insider threats before they cause harm.</p>
